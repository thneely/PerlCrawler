# PerlCrawler
A basic web crawler/spider written in perl

I learned perl in 2 hours to make this program. I plan for this to be just my first use of perl.

This script uses a website that I was tasked with archiving for transfer to a new website. I did not have access to the original database, so I had to make this program.

This program will only create a list of all thread URLs. I will be making a second program that will take the list of URLs, and it will parse the HTML data, and save only the post bodies and replies in each thread.
